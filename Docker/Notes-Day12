Docker Volumes:


Volume mapping & port mapping to be done while creating the comntainer

if container is already created, you cannot mount volume

Volumes are used to preserve data of the container on the local docker host

In this case if the container get deleted in future, the container data will still be available on the host machine in the volume

Volumes are always available under docker area

/var/lib/docker/volumes   ---> docker area

Types of volumes:

 > Named volume

step1: Create Volume and give a name to it

  $ docker volume create myvol

  $ docker volume inspect myvol

 $ docker volume ls

you will find the volume created user

/var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data

Inside the _data directory, containers data will be preserved


Step 2:   mapping (Associating ) volume to the container
*******

for mapping volume the run option is  -v or --volume

on a container multiple volumes can be mapped

 i) preserving data from container to volume

  which directory of container do you want to preserver :  /tmp

   $ docker run -it --name c1 -v myvol:/tmp centos


 container directory whose data will be preserved : /tmp

 where will data be preserved: mount point : /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data


Verify if really data is available in  volume or not

 $ cd /var/lib/docker/volumes/myvol/_data

data from contaienr will be available


ii) delete the container and check if data is still available or not on the host machine in volume



** 2 : data form volume can be made available on the container  ==> by Volume mapping

** 3: share the data between container  ==> using docker volumes

       1 volume cna be mapped to multiple containers


**   > /etc/conf.xml this file is on the host machine
and  i want it to be available on my container logstash in directory  /var/log

Answer: Using volumes we can make data form host directory to be available on container directpry


> Bind Mounts
*********

  mapping any host directory to container directory

 
 $ docker run -d -v /hostDir:/containerdir imagename

in this case no named volumed volume is created

no _data folder will be there in /var/lib/docker/volumes



End to end scenario for deployment of code on a httpd container

Delete containers:

docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)

Code repository:

https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git


make the code to be available on local docker host

$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Sonal0409/ecomm.git

$ cd ecomm

Create  a container using image httpd and place code files on the container

Access the container from browser


  $ docker run -d --name myweb -p 8282:80 -v /root/ecomm:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ httpd
