Master & Slave Set up in jenkins


Complete set on Slave machine

 > 1 ec2 machine of linux OS
 
connect to server

$ sudo su -

 > install git 
  yum install git -y

 > install java

yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

> install maven

yum install maven


Create the workspace directory also known as root directory

 $ cd /tmp

 $ mkdir jenkinsdir

 $ cd jenkinsdir

 $ pwd   ==>it will give present working directory==> /tmp/jenkinsdir

 $ chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir   ==> read write permission to directory

Day 10 Notes:
**********

Initial Configuratio on Master(where jenkins is already installed) for agent communication:

go to manage jenkins

 > go to Configure system
 > Jenkins IRl value pls give latest jenkins URlv == http://18.217.142.195:8080/
Save

On jenkins master we need to open ports for agent communication

go to manage jenkins

 > go to Configure global security

 > scroll to Agents ==> select Random option

Save the changes


Go to Linux slave and check its configuration
********

$ sudo su -

 > install git 
  yum install git -y

 > install java

yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

> install maven

yum install maven


Create the workspace directory also known as root directory

 $ cd /tmp

 $ mkdir jenkinsdir

 $ cd jenkinsdir

 $ pwd   ==>it will give present working directory==> /tmp/jenkinsdir

 $ chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir   ==> read write permission to directory  



Lets configure Master to connect to slave

setting up an Agent on Master:

************
go to Manage nodes and clouds

All these steps are to be performed on the master machine

  Name to the slave
  select permanent agent
  press create
 
  how many job you want to run on the salve at the same time ==> Number of executors = 1

  where the workspace will be created on the slave ==> /tmp/jenkinsdir

  label the slave, give a tag name  ==> give linux_slave
 
  Usage : select the 2nd option ==> only build jobs with label expression matching this node/Agent

  Launch method:  select launch via ssh

  using ssh(secured shell) we will connect to the slave

    > private ip of the slave  ==> 172.31.11.152

  Credentials:

    click on add --> select jenkins
          > select ssh Username & private key
            > git id  ==> myid
            > give description ==> agent credentials
            > username : ec2-user
            > private key ==> enter directly ==> copy the pem fiel content form downloads folder
                    ==> click on add and paste it over there
   > save

undeer credentials drop down  --> you will see the credenatials.. slect them


Host key verififcation: select non verification strategy

Node properties ---> add tool location:

add

defualt is git

go to linux slave ==> execute the command 

$ which git

/usr/bin/git

on jenkins
Under home add the path == /usr/bin/git


click on ADD

ij the drop down select ==> java tool name ==> myjava

go to linux slave ==> execute the command 

mvn --version

take the path of java_home variable

/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.312.b07-1.amzn2.0.2.x86_64

and paste in the master 

Click on save button

agent will connect with master


Now lets run jobs on slave
