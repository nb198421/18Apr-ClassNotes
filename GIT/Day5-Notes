github

> open source remote server to save your files and share your files
> internet connectivity to work on github
> valid user account to create a repository on github

repository created on github is called remote repository

scenario 1:


Configuring Local machine to GITHUB account

whenever we want changes that we have in local repository to be pushed in remote repo on github

we have to be authenticate

communicate from local to github ---> 

1. username/personal access token over https

2. over ssh


passwordless authentication:

generate ssh key on your local system


 ssh-keygen

press enter 3 times

key will be generated

cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

go to github --> settings --> ssh & GPG keys --> new ssh key

add the key in github and save

Scenario 2:

Create a remote repository
**********

Done

Scenario 3:

git push origin master

pull & fetch changes

git pull origin master

git fetch origin master
